|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variables**          | Containers for storing data values. Use `var`, `let`, and `const`.      | Store and manage data values in a program.                      |
| **Data Types**         | Different types of data: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, etc.  | Classify and handle various kinds of data (e.g., text, numbers). |
| **Operators**          | Symbols for operations on variables and values.                         | Perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.          |
| **Functions**          | Blocks of code that perform a task.                                     | Reusable pieces of code for executing specific tasks.            |

| **Closures**           | Functions that capture the lexical environment in which they were created. | Maintain state and data across different function calls.         |
| **Callback Functions** | Functions passed as arguments to other functions.                       | Handle asynchronous operations or events by executing functions later. |
| **Promises**           | Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. | Manage and handle the results of asynchronous operations.        |
| **Async/Await**        | Syntax for handling asynchronous operations more easily.                | Simplify asynchronous code by using `async` functions and `await` keyword. |
| **Error Handling**     | Mechanism to handle errors using `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.           | Handle errors gracefully and ensure code runs correctly under error conditions. |
| **Events**             | Mechanisms to handle user interactions and other events.                | Respond to user actions like clicks or system events like loading. |
| **DOM Manipulation**   | Techniques for modifying the HTML and CSS of a webpage using JavaScript. | Change the content, structure, or style of a webpage dynamically. |
| **JSON**               | JavaScript Object Notation, a format for storing and exchanging data.   | Serialize and deserialize data for communication between systems. |
| **Local Storage**      | Web storage for saving data on the client-side using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. | Store data on the client's browser for persistent or session-based needs. |

## Advanced Concepts

| **Concept**            | **Description**                                                        | **Main Use**                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prototypes**         | Mechanism for inheritance in JavaScript, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods. | Implement inheritance and shared properties across objects.     |
| **Inheritance**        | Technique to create a new class or object that inherits properties and methods from an existing one. | Create new classes that extend or modify existing ones.         |
| **Modules**            | Code organization feature, using `import` and `export` statements to modularize JavaScript code. | Break down code into reusable modules or components.            |
| **Generators**         | Functions that can be paused and resumed, using `function*` and `yield` keyword. | Generate sequences of values over time or pause execution.      |
| **Iterators**          | Objects that enable iteration over a collection of data, using `Symbol.iterator`. | Traverse data structures like arrays or objects.               |
| **Map/Set**            | Data structures for storing unique values (Set) or key-value pairs (Map). | Manage collections of unique values or key-value mappings.      |
| **Symbol**             | Primitive data type for creating unique identifiers.                    | Create unique values for object properties to avoid naming conflicts. |
| **WeakMap/WeakSet**    | Collections similar to `Map` and `Set`, but with weak references to keys/values. | Store data with garbage collection of keys/values when no longer needed. |
| **Reflect API**        | Provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations.                | Perform low-level operations on objects, such as property access. |
| **Proxy API**          | Allows creating a proxy object that can intercept and redefine fundamental operations on objects. | Control and customize interactions with objects.               |
| **Class Syntax**       | ES6 syntax for defining classes with constructors, methods, and inheritance. | Create and manage objects using a more structured class-based approach. |
| **Destructuring**      | Syntax for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. | Simplify assignment of values to variables from arrays or objects. |
| **Rest/Spread Operators** | Syntax for handling multiple elements in arrays or objects (`...`).   | Collect and distribute elements or properties in arrays and objects. |
| **Template Literals**  | String literals allowing embedded expressions, multi-line strings, and string interpolation using backticks. | Create strings with embedded expressions and multi-line content. |

## Performance and Optimization

| **Debouncing**         | Technique to limit the rate at which a function is executed.            | Prevent function execution too frequently, useful for events like typing. |
| **Throttling**         | Technique to control the execution rate of a function over time.        | Ensure functions are not executed too often, useful for events like scrolling. |
| **Lazy Loading**       | Technique for delaying the loading of resources until they are needed.  | Improve page load performance by loading resources only when required. |
| **Web Workers**        | Background threads for running scripts without blocking the main thread. | Perform heavy computations in the background without freezing the UI. |
| **Memory Management**  | Techniques for managing memory usage and garbage collection.             | Optimize memory usage and ensure unused objects are cleaned up. |
